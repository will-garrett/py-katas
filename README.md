### Numerical Combinations

This is a problem of my own, that I received in 3rd grade, the assignment, was to find a sequence of numbers using the digits 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, in that order, using at minimum three `+` operations and at least one `-` operation, and as many `✕` and/or `÷` as you wish, to equal `100`.

After some time, the answer provided by the teacher was 98 - 76 + 54 + 3 + 21, she didn't explain how to solve it, or expand on the answer, just gave us 20 minutes to work on it, I suspect she had a hangover and wanted some quiet time, she was a terrible teacher (Ms. Stith, Mantua Elementary, Fairfax, VA). 

The problem stuck with me, because I wanted to find OTHER answers to this problem. So, in this project I've removed the operator constraints for the three `+` and one `-` that to find any and all permutations.
